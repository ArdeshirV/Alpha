## What is Alpha Bot?

Alpha Bot is a Discord bot used for quickly pulling market information like charts, prices, details, schedule price alerts, and even execute trades on crypto exchanges. It's used by thousands of communities every day, and is by far the most advanced financial bot on the market.

# FAQ

**Can you add other indicators or timeframes to the bot?**

Unfortunately no, our data providers don't allow third-party indicators added to the charts. All built-in indicators and timeframes are already supported.

**Why doesn't Alpha use TradingView Premium?**

TradingView Premium is not available for the data provided by Alpha.

**I'm reaching the chart rate limit. Can I increase it?**

Yes, you can increase the limit by purchasing [Alpha Pro](https://www.alphabotsystem.com/pro "Alpha Pro").

**Why does Alpha have specific permission?**

- Send messages, read messages, read message history, attach files, embed links, add reactions: this allows Alpha to properly read and respond to commands, attach charts and add a checkbox after each sent image.
- Manage messages: by clicking on the checkbox under images sent by Alpha, the corresponding message will be removed.
- Change nickname: according to our Terms of Service, rebranding is not permitted. With that permission, Alpha can automatically fix the issue.
- Send TTS messages, use external emojis, manage Webhooks: can be turned off, used for future-proofing.

**Alpha doesn't post charts in the chat. How to fix that?**

Check the permissions given to Alpha and make sure it's allowed to read messages, send messages, and send attachments.
